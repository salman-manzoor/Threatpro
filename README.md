Install CPN tools from https://cpntools.org/
Open the model in the tool.
For the case of hierarchical petri net or the net is not visible, create a page and drag the net onto the page.
Open the simulation panel and simulate the model to generate the states and their reports.
For specific queries on the states, CPN ML can be used
